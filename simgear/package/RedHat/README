Building a SimGear RPM package for Red Hat

Please see the "package/openSUSE" directory for an
example how to build a SimGear RPM package with
shared SimGear libraries.

You may need to adapt the names (exact spelling) of some
of the package dependencies in the openSUSE RPM spec,
since these may slightly differ for Red Hat.

(If you have a working and tested Red Hat RPM spec,
you're welcome to contribute it to this project.)
