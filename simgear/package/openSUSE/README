Building a SimGear RPM package for openSUSE

(Last tested with openSUSE 11.4+12.1)

This directory contains the files which, along with
the source code tar files, can be used to build
an RPM package targeted at an openSUSE Linux system.

To build SimGear from source do the following:

1. obtain simgear-2.8.0.tar.bz2 (adapt version if
    necessary) and copy it into ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES

2. look in the BuildRequires section of SimGear.spec
   and check that all the packages referred to are
   installed (note, some of these packages may be part
   of openSUSE's "games" repository).

3. run 'rpmbuild -ba simgear.spec' and find the RPM
   build result in ~/rpmbuild/RPMS

That's all!
